    "##### 1) If you have trained five different models on the exact same training data, and they all achieve 95% precision, is there any chance that you can combine these models to get better results? If so, how? If not, why?\n",
    "***ANS :-*** Yes we can achieve more than 95% accuracy even though each model have only accuracy of 95% itself,this is because some models are guessing some instance right and some other models are guessing other right. This logic will be applicable till models are different , ie. either algorithim is defferent or train_data they are trained on are different <br>\n",
    "Since , each model have accuracy of 95% we cannot reduce importance/weight of any model so AdaBoosting is not an option hence we can use hard-voting"
